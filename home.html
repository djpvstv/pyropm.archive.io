                    With the first release of PyroPM, a few months of effort comes to a (temporary) end. And with a release comes a lot of features, including:
                    <h1></h1>
                    <b style = "line-height: 2.0;">Brand New Menus</b> - Beautiful redesigned menus make their debut with custom UI throughout.<br>
                    <b style = "line-height: 2.0;">Condensed Stagelist with New Stages</b style = "line-height: 2.0;"> - Duke it out on a select few balanced stages with a streamlined stage select.<br>
                    <b style = "line-height: 2.0;">Build Updater</b> - New update? No problem - Download the update directly from the launcher.<br>
                    <h1></h1>
                    And if you thought I was done...<br>
                    <h1></h1>
                    <b style = "line-height: 2.0;">New and Returning Characters</b> - Characters from past Smash games and newcomers join in with the first release of PyroPMEX, an addon pack to the main build.<br>
                    <h1></h1>
                    Download the build from the builds page or from <a href = "http://forums.kc-mm.com/Gallery/BrawlView.php?ByUserID=43957&Moderated=All">Brawl Vault</a>. You can download the main build as well as the PyroPMEX addon pack, or if you choose you can download the PyroPMEX standalone build. Each standalone build has options for Wii and Dolphin, and the addon build only contains files that you must install yourself. Read the installation guide under the builds page for further information.
