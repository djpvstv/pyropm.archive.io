                <h1>How does the presence of an official impact the panic levels in a group of people while in a fear-inducing situation?</h1>
                <p>
                    This study's purpose was to examine the effect of a trusted official on the levels of panic in a situation that inflicts large levels of fear.
                    The expected outcome of the research was that the presence of a trusted official would decrease the spread of panic throughout the group of people.
