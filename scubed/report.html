                <h1>How does the presence of an official impact the panic levels in a group of people while in a fear-inducing situation?</h1>
                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOverall, the central nervous system is most responsible for the pathophysiology of fear, and what causes fear and panic. Some regions of the brain that lit up during research and showed significance in inducing fear include the frontal and limbic regions (Cackovic, Nazir, Marwaha R, 2019). Any "unknown" fear or panic is managed by the limbic system; and the limbic region can be broken down further into the parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, and cingulate cortex. When the body begins to detect the situation that might induce fear, panic is then provoked by the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) and the cingulate cortex (Lai, Wu, 2016). Serotonin and how the body inhibits serotonin was also found to be a huge factor regarding how the body induces panic in people with or without panic disorders. Increased serotonin causes changes in the body's fear network and autonomic nervous system (Cackovic, Nazir, Marwaha R, 2019).<br>

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen fear strikes, the body and mind undergo physiological changes to alter energy levels, alertness, and strength; the "flight-or-fight" response is a product of the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system (Harvard Health Publishing Team, 2018). The chain of reactions shown above represent how the brain alerts the rest of the body to be in a state of fear. The Harvard Health Publishing Team (2018) also stated that the surge of epinephrine brings along many physiological changes that aid the body in an emergency situation. The body's heart rate increases to provide blood flow for the muscles to become faster and stronger, small airways increase size in the lungs for maximum oxygen intake that allows for increased alertness in the brain, and storage of glucose and fats is released into the bloodstream to be used for energy (Harvard Health Publishing Team, 2018).<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Harvard Health Publishing Team also informs that once the original flood of epinephrine subsides, the hypothalamus activates the 'hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and the adrenal gland' [HPA] axis. The hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone to the pituitary gland, where it triggers the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone that allows the body's heightened strength and senses to remain until the person is no longer in a state of panic once it travels to the adrenal glands to cause a surge of cortisol. While the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system is responsible for triggering the "flight-or-fight" response, the parasympathetic branch is responsible for triggering the "rest-and-digest" reaction that allows the body to use energy where it is needed during an emergency (Harvard Health Publishing Team, 2018).<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs Li, Tang, & Wang (2019) suggested, a population with high levels of trust in officials will effectively result in an increase in the recovered population. An official's presence is meant to ease the population that becomes panicked, in order to ensure a calmer populace when emergency responders arrive to the area (Li, Tang, & Wang, 2019.)<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAll of this information led us to develop our guiding research question: "How does the presence of an official impact the panic levels in a group of people while in a fear-inducing situation?"" We expected the outcome to be as follows: when authority and presence of an official is trusted at a higher level, then panic levels of the group would decrease. To test our theory, we charted those who were susceptible, infected, recovered, and susceptible once more to panic in an adapted SIRS model created in Python 3.2.5 run on IDLE. Li, Tang, & Wang (2019) outlined our notable compartments regarding the spread of panic in their similar model. Those who are considered susceptible easily change mindsets and become panicked. The infected group spreads panic to the surrounding people during the emergency. The recovered, or calm, group has experienced panic, yet calms down. The recovered group is also unstable because of the fact that their mindsets could change because of internal and external factors of the emergency, thus resulting in another susceptible group (Li, Tang, & Wang, 2019).

                <p>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs we hypothesized, the more trust put in guidance and/or the more guidance present, the fewer people become panicked and the quicker panic subsides (see Figure 5). Between an alpha of 0 and .5, every little increase in guidance significantly dropped the proportion of those in panic, but, beyond .5, the effectiveness of increased guidance lessened quickly.<br>

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn contrast to the peak amount of panicked, the peak time of panicked was only slightly affected by the change in the alpha value (see Figure 7). With our values, panic was already at a low peak time of about two even without any guidance at all. As such, the peak time could only be nudged so far by the alpha value before it is practically at minute zero.<br>
