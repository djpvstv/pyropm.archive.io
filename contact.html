                    Hey there! My tag is Pyro, and I am a competitive PM player and modder. I am a member of the Legacy XP dev team and a part of Project M Nexus, as well as an avid supporter of 3.6 tournaments and content. Want to join me at a tournament? Lynchburg Smash, in Lynchburg Virginia, holds a bi-monthly Smash tournament series called Flame Choke as well as weeklies for Smash Ultimate, and I often bring Project M to these events! Feel free to drop by or shoot me a message, and I'll be sure to respond when I can!
