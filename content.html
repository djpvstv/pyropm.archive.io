                    Menu Editing Guide
                </h1>
                <p>
                    A semi-comprehensive guide to editing the main menu. Due to the lack of knowledge about it, I dug a bit and got some of the information that makes it possible to make a fully custom main menu.<br>
                    Still incomplete, however it will be completed at some point in the near future.<br>
