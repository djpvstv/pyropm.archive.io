                    <p>&nbsp- Posted by Pyro on 1/6/21</p>
                </div>
                <p>I previously had set a deadline for myself to get this build out the door, and I already failed that one. Due to a lot of revision and designs for the menus and graphics and a lot of artist block, I had to step back and realize that the goal was not going to be met. However, in that time, a lot of new things have come to the modding scene and I want to update you all on the progress I have made and the work I have planned for the future.</p>
                <p style = "font-weight: bold; text-indent: 0px;">Base</p>
                <p>Before now, I was going to use a basic PMEX base, remove the added characters, and ship it. Now however, P+EX is on the horizon and I plan on using it to support PyroPM's base with all of it's new stability and features.</p>
                <p style = "font-weight: bold; text-indent: 0px;">Characters</p>
                <p>New characters will be removed to start, leaving the cast at the original 41 from Project M 3.6. In addition, characters will be reverted to their Project M 3.6 framedata and attributes, replacing the P+ balance changes to be back to the 3.6 patch.</p>
                <p style = "font-weight: bold; text-indent: 0px;">Stages</p>
                <p>The concept for the stagelist has remained mostly unchanged. Take the Paragon stagelist and expand it, adding new and old stages that can foster competitive play outside of a tournament environment.</p>
                <p style = "font-weight: bold; text-indent: 0px;">Menus</p>
                <p>This is a requirement for me, and it will be what requires the most work out of all of it. For this full menu overhaul, I plan on implementing my new, and hopefully final aesethics for the build. I plan on keeping this part a secret until release, so I hope that it will please you when it is finished!</p>
                <p style = "font-weight: bold; text-indent: 0px;">Timeline</p>
                <p>My previous goal was to be finished by the end of 2020, and if you have paid any attention, I already missed that one. I'm hesitant to set another date because I don't want to get everyone's hopes up, but I'm hopeful that this will be ready to release by the end of this year. I'm in college and I have no plans for summer break, so I'm hoping I can knock a lot of content out then.</p>
                <p>I do have some goals that I want to hit later once I have the first release out the door though...</p>
                <p style = "font-weight: bold; text-indent: 0px;">Characters</p>
                <p>Updated models and textures across the board. Sticking with the style Brawl has, but brightening up the palette to be more appealling overall alongside shiny metals and other material improvements. This was originally planned for the initial release, but turned out to be a massive undertaking that I don't think I can do alone.</p>
                <p>Improved GFX across the board. In a similar vein to P+'s improvements to characters like Zelda, I wanted to carry over and add new improvements to the cast as a whole. Like the previous, this is a bit out of my capabilities for the time being.</p>
                <p style = "font-weight: bold; text-indent: 0px;">Menus</p>
                <p>While the current guide is satisfactory, I wanted to update and improve the guide to contain everything needed to make a custom menu, instead of just how to move some things around.</p>
                <p>Now with all that out of the way, I wish you all a good 2021, cheers to start of a new era of Project M!</p>
