                    <p>&nbsp- Posted by Pyro on 6/27/20</p>
                </div>
                <p>While for most of you, PyroPM has been just some concept that no one but me knows about, hopefully this post will help clear up some of the plans and features you can expect come the first release and future releases of PyroPM.</p>
                <p style = "font-weight: bold; text-indent: 0px;">First Release</p>
                <p>This release will feature the standards for Project M builds at this point, including the code menu, 15 costumes per character, as well as new additions like stage file system neo and independent tracklists. In addition to these, PyroPM will feature a full UI redux, encompassing all of the menus and UI assets that do not affect gameplay.</p>
                <p>Unlike other builds, however, PyroPM will stray from the standard ASL system and focus on new and unique stages, each with their own slot and tracklist. Stages will feature unique layouts that foster semi-competitive play, growing and adding to the Paragon legal stagelist to create a large and varied selection of stages that are fun and interesting to play on. Each stage, new and old, will feature a new tracklist tailored to the stage, including many new and old tracks making an appearance.</p>
                <p>New characters in the build are unlike to be included in the first release, however BrawlEX will be implemented with the 50CC expansion so that new characters can be added to the game.</p>
                <p style = "font-weight: bold; text-indent: 0px;">Future Releases</p>
                <p>As I work on more and more content, PyroPM will change a bit after the initial release. The biggest change will be a split in the main build into two separate parts, the main pack and the content pack.</p>
                <p>The main pack will be a slimmed down version of the original release, including less stages and less music in order to function as a lightweight build for modders to use as a potential base.</p>
                <p>The content pack is where everything comes back, including the new UI, stages, music, and eventually characters are added back into the build. This pack is less focused on lightweight content, but instead including all of the bells and whistles to a complete PyroPM experience. Unlike the main pack, the content pack is not standalone, and requires the main pack to be installed first in order to use.</p>
                <p>Hopefully that sheds a little light into my plans for the build, and hopefully it garnered a little hype so that I can milk it for downloads. See you soon!</p>
