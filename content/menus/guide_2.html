                    Changing the Buttons
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Every button on the main menu is a 3D model. To change the buttons, it is as simple as editing the 3D model in the right spot.<br>
                    Every button has 6 animations, for:<br>
                    Entering<br>
                    Exiting while selected<br>
                    Entering (again)<br>
                    Exiting while not being selected<br>
                    Initial animation played when hovering over<br>
                    Loop animation while hovering over<br>
                    Certain buttons in Brawl have effects that loop only once. For example, the names button under the versus menu plays an animation of a pencil drawing a line, taking place in the MenMainIconXXXX_TopN__4 animation. Generally aim to keep animations the same frame count as the originals, as different lengths have not been experimented with.
