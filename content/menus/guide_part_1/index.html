                <h1>Menu Editing Guide - Changing the Buttons</h1>
                <p>Every button on the main menu is a 3D model. To change the buttons, it is as simple as editing the 3D model in the right spot.<br>Every button has 6 animations, for:</p>
                <p style = "font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.4; text-indent: 0px;">Entering while not selected (MenMainIcon0001_TopN__0)<br>Exiting while not selected (MenMainIcon0001_TopN__1)<br>Entering while selected (MenMainIcon0001_TopN__2)<br>Exiting while selected (MenMainIcon0001_TopN__3)<br>Initial animation played when hovering over (MenMainIcon0001_TopN__4)<br>Loop animation while hovering over (MenMainIcon0001_TopN__5)<br></p>
                <p>Certain buttons in Brawl have effects that loop only once. For example, the names button under the versus menu plays an animation of a pencil drawing a line, taking place in the MenMainIconXXXX_TopN__4 animation. Generally aim to keep animations the same frame count as the originals, but they can vary in length.</p>
                <p>All animations can have clr0 and srt0 animations paired with them, named to match the animation they are played with.</p>
