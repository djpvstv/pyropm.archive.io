                <p>
                    Before the rise of supermarkets and global fast food chains, all the food a consumer would purchase was farm-to-table. Everything from fruits in the fall, vegetables in the spring and 
                    summer, and year-round meats came directly from local farms. When fast food and food corporations came around, a lot of the fresh, local food began to disappear. For some areas, the local 
                    farms disappeared entirely, becoming known as a food desert.
                </p>
                <b>What is a food desert?</b>
                <p>
                    Oxford dictionary defines a food desert as "an urban area in which it is difficult to buy affordable or good-quality fresh food." Essentially, a food desert is a town or city where finding 
                    fresh, local food is near impossible. For many cities, the food desert is filled with fast food restaurants instead of supermarkets and grocery stores, and many residents cannot travel to a 
                    store.
                </p>
                <b>Why is it a problem?</b>
                <p>
                    Health problems are a concern for many, as the only options in the nearby area are unhealthy. Many fast food restaurants that are common in cities use overwhelming amounts of extra salt and 
                    fat, causing diet-related conditions like diabetes, obesity and heart disease. Due to the lack of healthy options, people inside a food desert often only eat these unhealthy foods, leading 
                    to serious health issues later on.
                </p>
                <b>What can be done?</b>
                <p>
                    Most food deserts are located in the heart of cities, where growing food is difficult or near impossible. However, some creative ideas can be used to circumvent this difficultly.<br>
                    <h4>Personal Gardens</h4>
                    Space is a big issue for cities, so gardeners have used many different types of planters to grow food everywhere, on roofs, on decks, even on walls.
                    Using the smallest of spaces to grow healthy food is possible with enough effort.
                    <h4>Farmer's Markets</h4>
                    Growing may be difficult in the city, but not outside! Many cities, including Lynchburg, have farmer's markets in the city where farmers can bring their crops in 
                    to sell. Normally this involves a lot more transportation, but the results can be great.
                </p>
                <b>In Conclusion</b>
                <p>
                    Food deserts are not easy to avoid and prevent, however with some effort and planning people can create and oasis or two for those in need of fresh and healthy food.
